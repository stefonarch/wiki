## Github Wiki

The main wiki files are located at https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki and https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt.wiki.git. Momentally only LXQt  with push access are able to edit.

## The improved Wiki

Located at https://github.com/lxqt/doc/wiki is a mirror of the main wiki files using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

It's possible to make PRs against it, also using the button on the single pages, but they cannot be merged but have to be copied to the main wiki atm.

## Updating

After changes to the main wiki files the mirror can be updated by selecting in the repository under "Actions" _pages-build_deployment_ on the left, click the last "pages build and deployment" and hit "Re-run all jobs".
