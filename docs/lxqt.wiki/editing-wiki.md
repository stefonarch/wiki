## Github Wiki

Those wiki files are located at https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki and https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt.wiki.git. 
Momentally only LXQt members with push access are able to edit but this should be avoided except for PCManFM-Qt's wiki.

## The improved Wiki

Located at https://github.com/lxqt/doc/wiki using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Edits can be done by 
 PRs against it or direct commit by LXQt members, most easyly using the edit button on the single pages. After the push the wiki is rebuilt by Github actions, the progress can be seen
 under the "Action" tab for both workflows. 

## Updating

After changes to the main wiki files the mirror can be updated by selecting in the repository under "Actions" _pages-build_deployment_ on the left, click the last "pages build and deployment" and hit "Re-run all jobs".
