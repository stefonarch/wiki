## The Github Wiki

Those wiki files are located at https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki and https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt.wiki.git. 
Temporarly only LXQt members with push access are able to edit but this should be avoided by now except for PCManFM-Qt's wiki.

## The improved Wiki

Located at [https://github.com/lxqt/doc/wiki](https://github.com/stefonarch/wiki/) using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Edits can be done by creating a 
 PR (or making a direct commit to main by LXQt members) - most easily using the edit button on the single pages. After the push the wiki is rebuilt by 2 Github actions, the progress can be seen under the "Action" tab for both workflows in the repository.
