Once you've got LXQt running you may want to look for additional software
complementing the desktop environment, in particular if you're new to LXQt,
Qt desktop environments or even Linux altogether.
So here's an overview what you may want to have a look at.   
More comprehensive lists of apps can e. g. be found
in the wikis of Linux distributions [Arch Linux], [Manjaro] or [Gentoo].   

## Display managers

The display manager recommended to be used with LXQt are [SDDM] or [greetd] but any other
display manager like GDM or LightDM is working, too.

## Complementary tools geared towards LXQt

A number of complementary tools exist providing features not included
in the desktop environment itself (yet).   

### UI

#### [Crystal Dock]
A dock for Wayland and X11, completely integrated with LXQt.
 
#### [lxqt-panel-profiles]

Backup and restore different panel configurations.

#### [sddm-conf]

GUI for editing SDDM configuration.

### Networking

#### [cmst] - QT GUI for Connman

Cmst provides a graphical user interface to control the connman daemon,
including a tray icon.

#### [nm-tray]

Panel plugin (widget) to control [NetworkManager],
unlike its preexisting counterparts written in Qt.
