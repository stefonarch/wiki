The only components relying on autotools are libfm and libfm-extra of LXDE which are needed by LXQt, too. But by now its' safe to use the precompiled packages providing theses libraries. This was reflected by stating them as prerequisite and means we'll only have to run <code>build_all_cmake_projects.sh</code>.

The most important ones are * <code>LXQT_PREFIX</code>: Base directory relative to which LXQt is installed. Points to <code>/usr/local</code> by default and should be set to <code>/usr</code>. Technically it is corresponding with CMake variable <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>. * <code>LIB_SUFFIX</code>: Path relative to <code>LXQT_PREFIX</code> libraries are stored in. Can be used to adjust the path to habits of Linux distributions where different paths like <code>/usr/lib</code>, <code>/usr/lib64</code> or <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> can be found. Technically it is corresponding with CMake variable <code>CMAKE_LIB_SUFFIX</code>.

In particular, Fusion and Plastik are rather well-behaved, while Oxygen enforces a shaded gradient and Kvantum will likely ignore them outright.</p> <p>A sample palette file, that of the base Clearlooks theme, is shown below - note the <code>[Palette]</code> header before the actual color definitions:</p> <pre><code>[Palette]\nbase_color=#ffffff\nhighlight_color=#80a0d0\nhighlighted_text_color=#ffffff\nlink_color=#0000ee\nlink_visited_color=#ffb3f7\ntext_color=#1a1a1a\nwindow_color=#edeceb\nwindow_text_color=#1a1a1a\n</code></pre> <p>Most of these are self-explanatory. For the rest: <code>window_color</code> refers to the \"bulk\" of an application, such as a file manager's menubars and controls, while <code>base_color</code> would govern the display pane with the icon or list view of the filesystem in it; likewise the <code>text_color</code> and <code>window_text_color</code> definitions.</p> <p>LXQt themes have the ability to pick up colors from the active palette, which allows for some interesting theming possibilities. For example, this is how Azuma Hazuki's Mint-Y LXQt themes collection works: rather than ship nearly two dozen redundant full themes, it consists simply of a light and dark variant along with a set of palettes, from which the themes draw their highlights and accent colors. Switching palettes changes these colors dynamically.</p>"},{"location":"Creating-LXQt-Themes.html#writing-themes","title":"Writing Themes","text":""},{"location":"Creating-LXQt-Themes.html#qt-stylesheet-syntax","title":"Qt Stylesheet Syntax","text":"<p>The syntax of .qss stylesheets should be immediately familiar to anyone who has worked with CSS, and is covered in great detail here.

Always document workarounds appropriately. When you fix a bug is also a good time to ask yourself if you shouldn't add a comment for it. </li> <li>On the other hand, do not over-comment. Do not simply repeat what the code says in English, comments should almost always add to the reader's comprehension.</li> <li>Keep a clean <code>git log</code>!

The encoding, usually <code>UTF-8</code> nowadays, frequently <code>ISO-8859-1</code> earlier, doesn't matter in this context.</p> <p>It is important to note that country specific translations are only used when a system's locale is set to the same country.  E. g. a Portuguese translation <code>pt_BR</code> is only used when a running system's locale is <code>pt_BR</code>, too. This translation does not get used if the system's locale is <code>pt_PT</code> (Portugal).  This means that no Portuguese translation is used at all should a system's locale be set to <code>pt_PT</code> and <code>pt_BR</code> be the only Portuguese translation that's available.</p> <p>Language specific files will always be used as fallback.  E. g. if two translations <code>pt_BR</code> and <code>pt</code> are available and a system's locale is set to <code>pt_PT</code> translation <code>pt</code> will be used.</p> <p>As a consequence a country agnostic translation like <code>pt</code> should be provided even if country specific translations are basically needed as long as not all of them are available yet.
